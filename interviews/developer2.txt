1) Are BRs helpful in software maintenance?


2) Can automated BR related software tasks (e.g., bug priority prediction) improve the efficiency of software maintenance?


3) If BureBERT based system can simultaneously implement the four BR related tasks including priority & severity predictions, BR summarization, and duplicate BR detection, do you think it is more meaningful than the previous tool aimed at a single task?


4) What are your requirements for such a system?


5) Do you have more expectations for this system?

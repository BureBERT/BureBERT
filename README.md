### BureBERT: Learning to Represent Bug Reports

Hello! Thanks for your attention on our work. BureBERT is a langauge model pretrained on BR corpus and can be fine-tuned on different BR related tasks, e.g., bug priority and severity prediction, bug report summarization, and duoplicate bug report detection.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on fine-tuning BureBERT on bug localization. Some developers think that it is helpful for bug fixing.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the requirements of developers who are interviewed by me.

#### Dependency
Successfully tested in Ubuntu 18.04
- Python == 3.7
- PyTorch == 1.6.0
- transformers == 4.17.0
- datasets == 1.17.0
- numpy == 1.18.5

#### Code Structure
- `brsumm`: It contains source code for bug report summarization.
- `bugpred`: It contains source code for bug priority and severity prediction.
- `dupbrdet`: It contains source code for duplicate bug report detection.

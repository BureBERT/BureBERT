### Bug priority & severity prediction

We provide the code for fine-tuning BureBERT on bug priority & severity prediction. To help you quickly run the code, we also provide a shell script to run the source code. So you can directly run our code by the following command: <br />
```bash
bash run_burebert_ft.sh
```
